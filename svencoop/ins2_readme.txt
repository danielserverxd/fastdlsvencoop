>>>>>Information & Notes<<<<<

Controls:
	Some weapons include a mode to change the firerate on them, 
you'll notice a sprite appear on your screen telling you the weapon's firerate (E + R to change them);

	Some other weapons also include Tertiary Attack functions (Like deploying the bipod, or changing to the GL mode),
To use these modes simply press the Mouse3 button (or whatever key you bound +alt1).

	This pack also includes a heavily modified version of the Buymenu plugin,
To open the buymenu, simply type: buy or /buy in the chat, or type .buy or buy in the console.

	There's a test map included with the pack titled "sc_insurgency", useful to test the map script and to check out all of
the weapons. It is merely a playground and has no purpose other than testing, it is not meant to be played on public servers.
