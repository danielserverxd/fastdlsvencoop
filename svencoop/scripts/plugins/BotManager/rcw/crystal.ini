# Should be Stairs then Control Panel after 2nd shortcut door - this would give players time to use the Panel (314)..
# But bots can't get into the vent at the box HT, piling up there & making it hard to position the box
# Set stairs (288) & Control Panel (314) to enable at same time and complete at same time, prev=272 - needs testing - done, works
