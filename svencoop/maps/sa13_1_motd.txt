===================================================================

Shape up soldier! I'm Captain Theunicgold, I will be leading this mission and the airforce fleet for now.

You have found the SA13 missiles launch base, which protects the world from foreign attacks. But it seems the ones in charge have sold themselves to bio-terrorists! 

The Tigers, the Sands, the Russian Mercs, the BDU (Big Ducks United), the Elite, the NGB (Not Great Beans), the NGT (New Generic Terrorists), the Tropic Troopers, and even damn ex-SAS operatives...

Mercenary groups from all around the world have gathered here with only one purpose: To launch alien-DNA-infused warheads and turn the entire world into mutants! We don't know where they are getting funding from, or why are they doing this. It is as if they have all been brainwashed. Something dark is going on in this island...

Your mission is to infiltrate beyond enemy lines, find a way inside the SA13 missiles control room, input new coordinates and launch them against the enemy! We will then clean the ashes...

Expect heavy resistance. We will be giving support when we can. This is war!


Objectives:

*   Destroy all enemies
