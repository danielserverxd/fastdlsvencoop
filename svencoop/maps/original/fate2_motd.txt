Other levels            : Tons of levels for Duke Nukem 3D (see my site, URL above),
                          one level for Unreal Tournament (MSUT1), two for Q3A 
                          (MSTourney1 & Lifeline), one level for Quake (Distractions)
                          and a small Counter-Strike map (aim_mesayard).  

Description             : A ten-level single-player mod for Half-Life. 

Plot                    : From my ModDB page: "What if Freeman weren't held in stasis during 
                          the portal storm that ravaged the Earth and caught the attention 
                          of the Combine? What if Freeman had a chance to prevent the Combine 
                          invasion from ever materializing? What if Freeman could reverse 
                          mankind's fate?"

Info:                   : I always look forward to finally getting to this point where
                          I can write the txt. Usually this means one or two hours
                          before your work is released to the public. However, like 
                          always, the uppermost feeling you have is frustration because
                          you have just spent weeks trying to fix bugs and improve 
                          gameplay. And, like always, the finished product is not 
                          everything you wanted it to be. However, these feelings tend
                          to be transitory. Let a few days, weeks or months pass and
                          the good times are all you remember although there never were
                          any.

                          As a long-time fan of Half-Life single-player mods, I had always 
                          wanted to make my own mod. Work on Fate Reversal began in December 
                          2007. The first map was a crude version of what is now
                          the fifth map (the night-time city). After just one month
                          I stopped working for about a year. In 2009 work on levels 1, 2, 3
                          (which was based on my Counter-Strike map), 4 and 7 began.
                          By May 2009 I had gone on another long break. I always knew that
                          this mod would see the light of day. While most people are poor 
                          at finishing the projects they start, I'm poor at abandoning 
                          projects. They're just too much work to be let go to waste. Work
                          resumed in January 2010 and I started working on levels 6, 8, 9 and 
                          10. The project went public in May. I swore that I'd have this 
                          thing done by the end of May/beginning of June. Otherwise my head 
                          would explode.

                          So, I've been in a "crunch" mode for the past few weeks, anxiously 
                          waiting for the day of my liberation which is today, the seventh of
                          June. Of course I could have kept on going, fixing bugs and improving
                          both design and gameplay but there's a point beyond which the benefits
                          of marginal improvements are simply not worth the trouble. In a world
                          of finite resources the time you spend on trying to get some stupid
                          multi_manager sequence just right is inevitably gone from some other, 
                          quite likely a billion times more productive activity.

                          Anyways. Now it's finally done and I'm free to pursue other
                          interests, which probably means starting another mapping project
                          in a few months. And so I'm off to watch some hockey.
                         
                                                  
Additional Credits to   : First of all, thanks to my beta-testers: Ben Greenwood (also 
                          helped me with getting Osprey to trigger something; check his 
                          mod "Operation Nova"), Stephane "Stef" Meganck (http://spmapcorner.blogspot.com/) 
                          & Luciano "Gambini" Gallo (http://gambinidesign.blogspot.com/). 
                           
                          HL mods such as Timeline 2 & 3, Sweet Half-Life, Life's
                          End, They Hunger and Someplace else served as primary sources
                          of inspiration. Also, Stephen King's "The Stand" influenced
                          the opening. David Kushner's "Masters of Doom", which tells
                          the story of John Carmack & John Romero, was a motivational
                          boost. The Gate Duke3D TC inspired me to make a space-themed
                          level.

                          TWHL, Snarkpit & Chatbear provided tons of userful tutorials. 
			  The Wavelength.net had a useful list of HL entities. 

                          Textures, skyboxes and models are mostly from fpsbanana and 
                          Wadfather (no longer running). I'd credit the authors of 
                          these materials directly if that were possible. Some textures
                          are from Counter-Strike, Hour-Glass & Dalek: Unbidden. Qwertyus 
                          provided the statue of Gordon Freeman. Some computer screens
                          are from cs_twhl by Rimrook. Sounds I found from internet sound
                          libraries such as PacDV and shockwave-sound.com. The street sound
                          in level 4 was used in a Duke3D map by Sanek & Zykov Eddy.
                          
                          Prefabs by Lucifucum (Bus Stop), Gtwalq, Marcus M, ComaWhite,
 			  Yak_Fighter, Freddy Kruger, Adam Grebinsky [ShadowByte], Brian 
 			  Wheeler, Robert and many others whose names were not available.

                          Websites such as tenfourmaps, ModDB and planetphillip are worth a
                          mention thanks to their attempts to keep the single-player 
                          mapping scene alive (not to mention that it was through 
                          tenfourmaps that I really got into the whole HL single-player
                          mod gaming).

                          Also thanks to the Duke3D Community, as always, and Iikka Kerï¿½nen
                          & George W. Bernard for their great Quake/Duke3D maps that got me
                          into mapping and taught me a lot.

                          Version 1.1 update: Thanks to people at Planetphillip, moddb, 
                          AMC forums and the Abandoned Workshops for feedback. Thanks also
                          to anyone who might have posted this mod online and thus helped
                          distribute it.

                          "To the people I forgot, you weren't on my mind for some reason 
                           and you probably don't deserve any thanks anyway." -Eminem
