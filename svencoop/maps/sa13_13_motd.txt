===================================================================

The last of the enemy forces are gathering around the highest mountain on the island. We are pushing with our forces thinning out their ranks.

You, on the other hand, will have to infiltrate on foot beyond the enemy lines, assisted by our choppers, and reach the mountain top where we believe something dark is brewing and must be eliminated.


Objectives:

*   Advance through the last enemy lines

*	Reach the mountain top
