"Abeyance" is a surreal experience and follows Jane Doe into her final push to
get free of the G-Man's grasp. Will she be a prisoner or will she find her strength to gain
her freedom again?

This is set directly after the events of "Autonomy Lost" so it is recommended
that you play that before continuing with this.
