  	Subject: Offer of Employment

  	Dear Mr. Walter Bennett,

  	Black Widow Inc. would like to invite you to join our
  	organization. You would be assigned as a member of the
  	multi-disciplinary scientific team on board of the USS
  	DARKSTAR, in a zoological research expedition to seek out,
  	collect and investigate new alien life-forms in unexplored
  	sectors of the universe.

  	This mission occurs in the year 2066, but since you have
  	already travelled to the future before, this should not be a
  	problem for you. The space-time window to come to our present
  	time will be available in just a few days, please decide ASAP
  	about your interest in this job opportunity.

  	You have been selected for this position by Cmdr. Neil Manke
  	due to your broad knowledge on advanced biochemistry and
  	extensive experience interacting with hostile aliens. Your
  	proven capacity to survive under critical conditions was also
  	considered. But actually you don't have anything to worry
  	about, our project is adopting the most rigorous safety
  	measures to prevent incidents. I can personally guarantee
  	everything is under control and none of the crew will be ever
  	submitted to any risk situations whatsoever. This is
  	certainly going to be a calm, quiet and relaxing journey, as
  	you can already predict from the pictures of our impressive
  	spaceship installations at <www.planethalflife.com/manke>.

  	We are looking forward to having you on our team!

  	Dr. Einar Saukas
  	Administration Office
  	Black Widow Inc.
  	Project USS DARKSTAR


Mr. Walter Bennett was one of the several famous scientists
invited to participate on this mission. You are Dr. Gordon
Freeman, a brilliant researcher that always had problems to
wake up on time...
