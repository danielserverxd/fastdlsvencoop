===================================================================

You have been flown as far as the pilot could take you near the mountain top. The enemy is weakened and these are their last forces. 

Infiltrate the mutant laboratory, free our captured soldiers and reach the top of the hill. That's the portal they are using to reach the mountain top.

These wankers will know what Sven Co-op means by the end of the day!


Objectives:

*	Attempt to rescue the friendly soldiers

*	Reach the mountain top
