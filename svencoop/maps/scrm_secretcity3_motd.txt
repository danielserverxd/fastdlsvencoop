-------
Locked in a stupid pointless building in the middle of some random city,
you must find solutions to puzzles and use teamwork to get through some puzzles.
THIS MAP IS A BETA, BECAUSE I HIT THE ENTITY LIMIT AND CAN NOT ADD ANY MORE TO IT.
I will be -trying- to convert it to HL2 though, as soon as I have the ability to do it successfully.

Thanks to the following people for material and support and lots of other stuff:

Slidje: ideas, support and some new textures, always helped with testing the map.
Burnout64: ideas, support, helping with playtesting.
FTP Keen: bizzare ideas, support, helping with playtesting.
Everyone on the third floor who made their own rooms.

Ice/Snow textures by Deraj, whose website was mapfinger.com, which now appears to be owned by one of those annoying search engine websites. I downloaded the textures from Crinity; ( http://www.planethalflife.com/crinity/ )
